# Riddler
Used for programmatic solutions to problems from The Riddler by FiveThirtyEight

## Structure
For each new edition of the Riddler (every Friday), if I have a programmatic solution to the riddle, 
I will create a new subdirectory named the date of the Riddler post, as well as a new dev branch named
"dev_{date}" for that specific riddle.
 
 ## Further Reading
 I may also write in more detail about a given week's solution at www.austinnar.com/blog
